# AEIconizer

**Sketch plugin for automatic scaling of iOS app icon artwork in all needed sizes.**

> After creating icon in any square sized artboard,
select any layer (or nothing if that's the only artboard on page),
then run this plugin to generate all of the needed sizes for iOS (or watchOS and others).  
**Plugin replaces all generated artboards every time it runs, but it will never delete your original artboard.**
